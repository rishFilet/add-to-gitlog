# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing react in a real world application. Completed a donate Call to Action button with colour animation and confetti using react-dom-confetti

**Thoughts** First time using react and it is very similar to dart, easy to pick up but can be seen hard to master.

### Day 2: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-started flutter/dart and created a home screen with active buttons and retrieving an image using api

**Thoughts** After leaving flutter for almost a year, i found it alot easier to pick back up given that i understand programming concepts a lot better and able to translate the code and what it is doing. An example is seeing how constructors/intiailisers work. It is easier to figure out the code and cleaner architecture having this experience. This means that the more i practice concpets as opposed to specific syntax, i can learn any language or stack pretty quickly.

### Day 3: September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fixing the animation for the donate button on TTM website. Fixed layout issues with text, button and heart. Made heart grow with hover over button.

**Thoughts** Animations are very tough in web dev. I have a new respect for how much effort goes into making an animation for a webpage now.

### Day 6: September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added optimisations to make the website load faster by preloading images and not loading the html until the react is loaded. This was done using React Hooks

**Thoughts** React hooks are very powerful and the difference between componentDidMount and effects is that effects can be used in a functio and does not need a class. Preloading fonts, especially ones from a url are better set to load in the cache using a plugin. They can be checked in the network inspector of the website to see which elemnts are taking the longest to load. Preloading and prefetching is important and seeing that things load in a correct order.

### Day 7: September 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on preloading fonts for other sections of the page, specifically with loading fonts that are using materialUI styling. Still trying to figure out why the logo and skyline header are loaded after the html is loaded causing some breakage

**Thoughts** Loading fonts is different when using material UI for styling. Adding a placeholder is a good idea (such as a blurred photo) when loading images to give the effect of progressive loading but this does not solve the images not loading when the site first loads up.
