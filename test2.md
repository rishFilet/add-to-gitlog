**Today's Progress**: Worked more on preloading fonts for other sections of the page, specifically with loading fonts that are using materialUI styling. Still trying to figure out why the logo and skyline header are loaded after the html is loaded causing some breakage

**Thoughts** Loading fonts is different when using material UI for styling. Adding a placeholder is a good idea (such as a blurred photo) when loading images to give the effect of progressive loading but this does not solve the images not loading when the site first loads up.
